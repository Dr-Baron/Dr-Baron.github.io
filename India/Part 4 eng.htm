<p class=MsoNormal>Delhi has been the capital of India many times. That is,
many rulers built their capital on the site of today's Delhi. Delhi was the
capital of the Lodhs, the Mughals (from Shahjahan to Bhadurshah Zafar), and, of
course, now. In 1398, Timur practically destroyed and plundered the entire
city. Babur conquered Delhi in 1526, but ruled from Agra. His son Humayun chose
Delhi as his capital, but was expelled from it by Sher Shah Suri. Only 15 years
later, he regained power, defeating Sher Shah's nephew. Humayun died in 1556 as
a result of an accident, leaving his 13-year-old son Akbar as ruler. Akbar
ruled for half a century: 8 years from Delhi, then he moved the capital to
Agra, and later to Fatehpur Sikri. Shahjahan returned to Delhi after ruling for
11 years in Agra, and all subsequent Mughals ruled in Delhi until Bhadur Shah
Zafar and the British rule.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Delhi formally consists of 2 parts: Old Delhi and New Delhi.
In fact, Old Delhi is the city of Shahjahan, where he moved the capital from
Agra in 1648. The reason: Agra's harsh climate and narrow streets for imperial
processions. Although Shahjahan never completely moved to Delhi, as his son
Orangzeb imprisoned him in Agra Fort.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u>Old Delhi</u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Old Delhi, like other Indian cities, is a big market,
traders, beggars, cattle and dirt. Another name for the old city is
Shahjahanabad. In 1857, in a battle between the Mughals and the British, the
city was mostly destroyed. The following have survived:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Shahjahan's Red Fort,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The huge Jama Masjid mosque, which can accommodate 20,000 worshipers at
a time. The parishioners believe that the mosque contains a long red hair of
the Prophet Muhammad. The mosque was built in 1644-1658, and Shahjahan himself
came to pray there on Fridays from the Red Fort. A very beautiful, huge mosque
with minarets, and is visible from afar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Cha&nbsp;ndni Chawk Silver Street, the central street of Old Delhi,
leading, as planned by Shahjahan, from the Red Fort to the Jama Masjid mosque.
Now it is transformed into a bazaar and a crowd; noise, smells, cattle, crowds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>some old gates.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Around the Old City is New Delhi. The name is deceptive: New
Delhi is older than Old Delhi, and has more attractions. New Delhi resembles a
city more than other cities in India. Wide, straight streets, almost no trash,
and men don't pee. But the traffic is still&nbsp;crazy and without any special
rules, everyone is as fast as they can. Lots of police and soldiers with
machine guns, especially in the government part of Delhi.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u>Lakshminarayan Temple</u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is a new temple, built in 1938 and consecrated by
Mahatma Gandhi. Large, beautiful, with various compartments, and very popular
in Delhi. This is a temple to all three main gods: Bramha&nbsp;(the creator),
Vishnu (the preserver) and Shiva (the destroyer). In addition to the main ones,
there are statues of the goddess of wealth and prosperity Lakshmi, Vishnu's
wife; the goddess of strength and power Durga, the goddess of education
Saraswati, as well as all sorts of elephants and leopards. There is also the god
Rama, who is nothing more than the soul of the deceased Vishnu, reincarnated
into another body.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Swastika decorations are everywhere, and separately on the
wall is its explanation. The swastika has been an emblem of the Aryan (i.e.
Hindu!!!) civilization and culture for over 8,000 years and signifies success,
development and all kinds of well-being.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While I was walking around the temple, the tour guide kissed
the steps, prayed and painted his forehead between his eyebrows red and yellow,
as he explained, for further well-being and blessing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u>Memorial at the cremation site of Mahatma Gandhi</u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Quite modest, but with an eternal flame. Nearby is a similar
memorial at the site of Jawaharlal Nehru's cremation. Hindus cremate bodies and
scatter the ashes into the sacred Ganges. The Ganges is considered sacred
because even with all the ashes that fall into it, its water is pure and clear.
Hemal says that any bottled or tap water will settle after a while, but the
Ganges never will. If a person is too poor to take a relative's ashes to the
Ganges, he sprinkles them into the Yamuna River (Delhi is also on the Yamuna),
which flows into the Ganges. If there is no Yamuna at hand, the ashes are
sprinkled into any river and they pray that they somehow end up in the Ganges.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u>Capital</u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Luxurious, beautiful administrative part of Delhi.
Magnificent capital. A wide avenue passes between two huge buildings of
ministries and leads to Rashtrapati Bhavan - the Presidential Palace. On the
Independence Day of India, the festive parade starts from here. The
Presidential Palace has 300 rooms and is considered the largest in the world
(among presidential palaces?). The whole area was built by the British in
1911-1930. There is especially a lot of police here, because recently a
terrorist attack almost happened. Nearby on the square is the Parliament
building. On the other side is the impressive India Gate, built in memory of
the Indians who died for the British in World War I.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u>Humayun's Mausoleum</u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Humayun is mostly known as the second Mughal, son of Babur
and father of Akbar. He did nothing special and died early. According to the
book, Humayun was seriously ill, and his father Babur walked around his bed 7
times to take his illness upon himself. And so it happened: as soon as Humayun
began to recover, Babur fell ill and died.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After becoming emperor, Humayun decided to build a new
capital, Dinapanah, in Delhi. However, he was defeated by Sher Shah Suri and
lost power for 15 years. He managed to regain the throne, but soon died after
falling down the steps (Rajiv blames Humayun's passion for opium).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The mausoleum was built by Humayun's widow in 1556-1565.
There are about 100 burials of relatives in the side rooms, including three
beheaded brothers of Aurangzeb. Humayun's mausoleum is the first example of
Mughal architecture in India. It is a huge complex, like the Taj Mahal and
Sikandra; symmetry, canals, gardens, gates on three sides. The forms are
similar to the Taj Mahal, and inside it is practically the same, two levels of
arches, but Humayun's are not white, but red. In some places - white marble.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u>Qutab Minar</u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Qutab Minar is a huge column built by Muslims in the 12th
century when they first came to India. A very tall column with decorations,
reliefs, drawings and inscriptions. It is considered a mixture of Muslim and
Indian architecture. Only 72.5 meters high. It is a symbol of Delhi, standing
above the ruins of many cities that existed on the site of Delhi. One began to
build it, and his followers completed the column higher and higher.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is believed that the column was intended as a minaret,
but was never used for this purpose. Indeed, from such a height no one would
have heard the call of the muezzin anyway...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Around the column is a former Hindu temple, converted into a
mosque by Muslims. Nearby is the beginning of another column. One of the Muslim
rulers planned to build it twice as high as Qutab Minar, but he built only the
base and died.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The most amazing thing is that there is an ancient iron
column on the temple grounds. The text engraved on it determined its age: 4th
century! And no rust. Some special alloy was used for it. It was part of an
ancient Hindu temple. The text is written in Pali.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u>Safdarjang's Tomb</u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Safdarjung was also a Mughal, but like all rulers after
Aurangzeb, he did not have power over India, but was only the prime minister of
one of the states. He is considered the last (noble) Mughal. It seems that he
is famous only for the fact that his tomb is the last in the style of Mughal
architecture. The mausoleum and the whole complex are much more modest than
Sikandra, Humayun's tomb in Delhi, and of course, the Taj Mahal, although it is
similar to them, especially to Humayun's tomb.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u>Red Fort</u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Red Fort is the central landmark of Delhi; it was built
by Shahjahan as an imperial palace and fortress. It was built on the banks of
the Jamuna River, but the river naturally changed its course and now flows some
distance away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Red Fort is similar in many ways to Agra Fort, Fatehpur
and Amber Fort:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A high wall and a moat around the fortress; hanging bridges; beautiful
gates, high enough for the emperor to ride ceremoniously on an elephant: Lahore
Gate (from here the road to Lahore begins), Kashmir Gate (respectively, to
Kashmir), Delhi Gate, Water Gate (facing the river). Streams of bullets and
arrows were rained down on the advancing enemies from the walls of the Fort,
and hot oil was poured. Nevertheless, the fortress fell under the onslaught of
the British in 1857, after fierce fighting. The then ruler Bhadurshah Zafar,
the last of the Mughals, was overthrown and exiled to Burma, where he is
buried. We entered through the Lahore Gate, on which traces of bullets and
shells are visible. Long before the British, the Persian Nadir Shah managed to
conquer the Red Fort, from where he took the famous Koh-i-Noor diamond to
Persia;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In front, as in other palaces, the DIVAN-I-AM = public audiences. A
sumptuous throne to which petitions were presented. The prime minister received
petitions and, if he considered it necessary, passed them on to the emperor,
who made the decision.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Behind is the DIVAN-I-KHAS = private audiences. These halls were mainly
used for entertainment. That's why nearby, in the same courtyard:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>--&nbsp;Hammams = baths. Actually, 3 baths: cold, hot, and one bath
where you could mix cold water with hot,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>--&nbsp;Rang Mahal = palace for women: some wives and their servants,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>--&nbsp;Khas Mahal = bedrooms etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Nearby is the small Pearl Mosque, Shahjahan prayed there six days a
week, and on Fridays he was not lazy, he went to Jama Masjid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in'>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the center is a large fountain made from a single piece of white
marble.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The British ruled India from the Red Fort until they built a
large complex in New Delhi in the early 20th century. It was here, from the
walls of the Red Fort, that India's independence was declared in 1947. Official
parades and celebrations are held in front of the Fort every year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are a lot of soldiers and police around, because they
have had terrorist attacks before. In December, some guy opened random shooting
in the Red Fort. After that, unfortunately, no one is allowed through the
beautiful Delhi gate with elephants.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u>Sunehri Mosque</u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A relatively small mosque, lost in the treetops. I asked to
go there just to see the late Mughal architecture. Beautiful, like everything
Mughal, but the proportions are wrong, and Anand agreed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u>Jama Masjid Again</u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the end we drove up to the Jama Masjid mosque again,
because I read that you can climb one of its tall minarets. Indeed, but they
don't let you in alone. I waited for two German women, and we climbed up
together, up a steep and completely dark staircase. From there - a gorgeous
view of the whole of Old Delhi... if it weren't for the fog. It was a farewell
to Delhi and India.</p>
