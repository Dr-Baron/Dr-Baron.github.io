<i> Abstract.<br>
Under standard conditions of change-point problems with one or
both distributions being unknown, we propose efficient on-line and off-line
nonparametric algorithms for detecting and estimating the change-point.
They are based on histogram density estimators, which allows applications
involving ordinal and categorical data. Also, they are designed to detect
any changes in distribution, not necessarily related to the location or scale
parameters.
Efficiency of the proposed schemes is demonstrated by relevant inequalities for
the mean delay and the mean time between false alarms.
Asymptotically, they are shown to behave similarly to the most efficient
procedures based on the known distributions. The stopping rule achieves an
asymptotically linear mean delay and an exponential mean time between
false alarms. The guidelines on selecting the threshold and the partition for
the histogram density estimation are given, based on the obtained results.
Proposed methods are applied to the England temperatures data
and the Vostok ice core record to detect the global climate changes.

<i> Abstract.<br>
The distribution of stochastically discounted sums (perpetuities)
is studied.
For Bernoulli-type variables a
 canonical representation of this distribution is obtained, and it
 is proven to be singular continuous.
 In the asymptotic  setting of the change-point estimation problem
 the limiting behavior of the posterior distribution is shown
 to be given by two  independent perpetuities.

<br><br>
<i> Abstract.<br>
In the Bayes sequential change-point problem, an
assumption of a fully known prior distribution of a change-point is
usually impracticable.  At every moment, one often knows only the
discrete hazard function, that is, the probability of
a change occurring before the next observation is collected, given that it
has not occurred so far. In the randomized model, the observed or predicted
values of the hazard function are assumed to form a Markov chain.
Under these assumptions, the optimal change-point detection
stopping rules are derived for two popular loss functions introduced in
Shiryaev (1978) and Ritov (1990).
Derivations are based on the theory of optimal stopping of Markov sequences.

<i> Abstract.<br>
Whereas it is customary to announce epidemics when influenza mortality
exceeds the epidemic threshold, one can often detect the
beginning of epidemics earlier, by solving a suitable
change-point problem. We propose a hierarchical Bayesian
change-point model for influenza epidemics.
Prior probabilities of a change point depend on (random) factors that
affect the spread of influenza. Theory of optimal stopping is used to
obtain Bayes stopping rules for the detection of epidemic trends
under the loss functions penalizing for delays and false alarms.
The Bayes solution involves rather complicated computation of
the corresponding payoff function. Alternatively,
asymptotically pointwise optimal stopping rules
can be computed easily and under weaker assumptions. Both methods are applied
to the 1996--2001 influenza mortality data published by CDC.

Consistent estimation of early and frequent change points. 
In <i>J. Haitovsky, H. R. Lerche, and Y. Ritov, eds.,
Foundations of Statistical Inference</i>, pages 181--194, Springer,
Physica-Verlag, Heidelberg, New York, 2003. </font>
<br><br>
<i> Abstract.<br>
 We address two types of processes with change points that often arise
 in practical situations. These are processes with early change points
 and processes with frequent change points.
 Early change points may occur after very few observations and may be
 followed by additional change points or more complicated patterns.
 Frequent change points separate different homogeneous
 phases of the observed process with the possibility of very short phases.

 Uncertainty of the considered processes during their later phases forces
 the use of sequential tools, in order to minimize samples from later phases.
 Change-point detection and post-estimation schemes for these
 situations are developed. They possess a number of desired properties, not
 satisfied by procedures proposed in the earlier literature. One of them
 is distribution-consistency. Unlike the traditional concept of consistency,
 it implies convergence of small-sample change-point estimators to the
 corresponding parameters as the magnitude of changes tends to infinity.

Consistent estimation in generalized broken-line regression.

</font>

<br>
<i> Abstract.<br>
A change-point model is considered where the canonical parameter of
an exponential family drifts from its
control value at an unknown time and changes according to a broken-line
regression. Necessary conditions and sufficient conditions are obtained
for the existence of consistent change-point estimators. When sufficient
conditions are met, it is shown that the maximum likelihood estimator of
the change point is consistent, unlike the classical abrupt change-point
models. Results are extended to the case of nonlinear trends and
non-equidistant observations.

Principles of optimal sequential planning, 
<i>Sequential Analysis</i>, 23(1), 11--32, 2004.</font>
</font><br><br>
<i> Abstract.<br>
It is often impractical or expensive to collect data according to a
classical sequential scheme, that is, one observation at a time.
Sequential planning extends and generalizes the ``pure''
sequential procedures by allowing to sample observations in groups.
At any moment, all the collected data are used to determine the size
of the next group and to decide whether or not sampling should be
terminated. 
<br><br>
This article discusses optimality of sequential plans in terms of a
suitable risk function that balances an observation cost and a group cost.
It is shown that only non-randomized sequential plans based on
a sufficient statistic have to be considered in order to achieve optimality.
Performance of several such plans is evaluated.

Small sample change-point analysis with applications to problem solving.

<i> Abstract.<br>
The proposed scheme detects and post-estimates change points
that can occur during early stages of an observed multistage process.
The algorithm is designed to analyze change points that are
likely to occur after very few observations and to be followed by
other change points or more complicated patterns. Such models are
justified in problem solving, quality control, and other processes.
Special methods are derived in
order to: (1) detect a change point even after a very brief period
of observation, (2) estimate it with the theoretically highest degree
of accuracy, (3) report a no-change case when a significant change
has not occurred during the observed period, and (4) use minimum data
after the change point to prevent mixing the post-change phase with
subsequent phases and patterns.
Unlike existing methods, the proposed algorithm produces a 
distribution consistent estimator of a change point. Details are
elaborated for the case of Gamma distributions and demonstrated for a
process of problem solving.

We introduce a wide class of asymmetric loss functions and show how

<i>Abstract. <br>
Under the most general conditions of a Markov random field, we model
the two-dimensional spatial distribution of microchips on a silicon wafer.
Its canonical parameters represent the density of failures,
main effects and interactions of neighboring
chips. Explicit forms of conditional distributions are derived, and maximum
pseudo-likelihood estimates of canonical parameters are obtained. This
ten-dimensional numerical characteristic summarizes general patterns of
clusters of failing chips on a wafer, capturing their size, shape, direction
density and thickness. It is used to classify incoming
wafers to known root cause categories of failures by matching them to
the closest pattern.

Pattern recognition in IC diagnostics using the linear
discriminant classifier and artificial neural networks. Under review.</font>
<br><br>
<i>Abstract. <br>
It is important in IC manufacturing to identify probable
root causes, given a signature. The signature is a vector of electrical
test parameters measured on process control bars on a wafer.
Linear discriminant analysis and artificial neural networks are used to classify a signature of test electrical measurements of a failed chip to one of several
pre-assigned root cause categories. 
An optimal decision rule that assigns a new incoming signature of a failed chip to a particular root cause category 
is employed such that the probability of misclassification is minimized.
The problem of classifying patterns with missing data, outliers,
collinearity, and non-normality are also addressed. The selected similarity metric in linear discriminant analysis, and the network topology, used in neural networks, result in a small number of misclassifications.
An alternative classification scheme based on the locations of failed chips on a wafer and their spatial dependence is proposed.</i>
