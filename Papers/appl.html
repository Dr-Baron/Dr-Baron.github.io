Markov random fields in pattern recognition for semiconductor

<i>Abstract. <br>
Under the most general conditions of a Markov random field, we model
the two-dimensional spatial distribution of microchips on a silicon wafer.
Its canonical parameters represent the density of failures,
main effects and interactions of neighboring
chips. Explicit forms of conditional distributions are derived, and maximum
pseudo-likelihood estimates of canonical parameters are obtained. This
ten-dimensional numerical characteristic summarizes general patterns of
clusters of failing chips on a wafer, capturing their size, shape, direction
density and thickness. It is used to classify incoming
wafers to known root cause categories of failures by matching them to
the closest pattern.

<i>Abstract. <br>
Power prices are modelled by a Markov chain switching between "regular" and "spike" phases according to the time of the year and other factors. Here we present simple methods of model calibration and optimal prediction.

<i>Abstract. <br>
Whereas it is customary to announce epidemics when influenza mortality
exceeds the epidemic threshold, one can often detect the
beginning of epidemics earlier, by solving a suitable
change-point problem. We propose a hierarchical Bayesian
change-point model for influenza epidemics.
Prior probabilities of a change point depend on (random) factors that
affect the spread of influenza. Theory of optimal stopping is used to
obtain Bayes stopping rules for the detection of epidemic trends
under the loss functions penalizing for delays and false alarms.
The Bayes solution involves rather complicated computation of
the corresponding payoff function. Alternatively,
asymptotically pointwise optimal stopping rules
can be computed easily and under weaker assumptions. Both methods are applied
to the 1996--2001 influenza mortality data published by CDC.

Pattern recognition in IC diagnostics using the linear
discriminant classifier and artificial neural networks. Under review.</font>
<br><br>
<i>Abstract. <br>
It is important in IC manufacturing to identify probable
root causes, given a signature. The signature is a vector of electrical
test parameters measured on process control bars on a wafer.
Linear discriminant analysis and artificial neural networks are used to classify a signature of test electrical measurements of a failed chip to one of several
pre-assigned root cause categories. 
An optimal decision rule that assigns a new incoming signature of a failed chip to a particular root cause category 
is employed such that the probability of misclassification is minimized.
The problem of classifying patterns with missing data, outliers,
collinearity, and non-normality are also addressed. The selected similarity metric in linear discriminant analysis, and the network topology, used in neural networks, result in a small number of misclassifications.
An alternative classification scheme based on the locations of failed chips on a wafer and their spatial dependence is proposed.</i>

Small sample change-point analysis with applications to problem solving.
Submitted.</font>
<br><br>
<i>Abstract. <br>
The proposed scheme detects and post-estimates change points
that can occur during early stages of an observed multistage process.
The algorithm is designed to analyze change points that are
likely to occur after very few observations and to be followed by
other change points or more complicated patterns. Such models are
justified in problem solving, quality control, and other processes.
Special methods are derived in
order to: (1) detect a change point even after a very brief period
of observation, (2) estimate it with the theoretically highest degree
of accuracy, (3) report a no-change case when a significant change
has not occurred during the observed period, and (4) use minimum data
after the change point to prevent mixing the post-change phase with
subsequent phases and patterns.
Unlike existing methods, the proposed algorithm produces a 
distribution consistent estimator of a change point. Details are
elaborated for the case of Gamma distributions and demonstrated for a
process of problem solving.</i>
