<i> Abstract. <br>
We introduce a wide class of asymmetric loss functions and show how
to obtain decision rules optimal under these losses from the commonly
used standard Bayesian procedures. Important properties of minimum risk and
minimax
estimators are established. In particular, we discuss their sensitivity
to the asymmetry of the loss function.

<i> Abstract. <br>
In the Bayes sequential change-point problem, an
assumption of a fully known prior distribution of a change-point is
usually impracticable.  At every moment, one often knows only the
discrete hazard function, that is, the probability of
a change occurring before the next observation is collected, given that it
has not occurred so far. In the randomized model, the observed or predicted
values of the hazard function are assumed to form a Markov chain.
Under these assumptions, the optimal change-point detection
stopping rules are derived for two popular loss functions introduced in
Shiryaev (1978) and Ritov (1990).
Derivations are based on the theory of optimal stopping of Markov sequences.

<i> Abstract. <br>
Whereas it is customary to announce epidemics when influenza mortality
exceeds the epidemic threshold, one can often detect the
beginning of epidemics earlier, by solving a suitable
change-point problem. We propose a hierarchical Bayesian
change-point model for influenza epidemics.
Prior probabilities of a change point depend on (random) factors that
affect the spread of influenza. Theory of optimal stopping is used to
obtain Bayes stopping rules for the detection of epidemic trends
under the loss functions penalizing for delays and false alarms.
The Bayes solution involves rather complicated computation of
the corresponding payoff function. Alternatively,
asymptotically pointwise optimal stopping rules
can be computed easily and under weaker assumptions. Both methods are applied
to the 1996--2001 influenza mortality data published by CDC.

Principles of optimal sequential planning,
<i>Sequential Analysis</i>, 23(1), 11--32, 2004.</font>
</font><br><br>
<i> Abstract.<br>
It is often impractical or expensive to collect data according to a
classical sequential scheme, that is, one observation at a time.
Sequential planning extends and generalizes the ``pure''
sequential procedures by allowing to sample observations in groups.
At any moment, all the collected data are used to determine the size
of the next group and to decide whether or not sampling should be
terminated. 
<br><br>
This article discusses optimality of sequential plans in terms of a
suitable risk function that balances an observation cost and a group cost.
It is shown that only non-randomized sequential plans based on
a sufficient statistic have to be considered in order to achieve optimality.
Performance of several such plans is evaluated.
